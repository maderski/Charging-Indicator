# Charging-Indicator
A simple app to help indicate the device is connected to power<br /><br />
I bought a wireless charger for my car and was unable to glance at the phone to tell if it was charging or not. I found the charging symbol on the battery icon is difficult to resolve when in the car. So I created an app that would make it easier to tell when the phone is charging.<br /><br />
